      "source": "New businesses all face the same issue before they even start operating: finding the ideal location. In particular, opening a new African restaurant in the city of Atlanta, Georgia is not an easy task. There are several common questions that new restaurant/business owners ask themselves[[1]](http://alltopstartups.com/2018/03/15/the-importance-of-location-in-business)[[2]](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/choosing-restaurant-location-2888543):\n<ul>\n    <li>Does the success of your restaurant rely heavily on customer traffic?</li>\n    <li>Does the location of the restaurant bring visibility?</li>\n    <li>Are there already other restaurants proposing the same service in the neighborhood?</li>\n    <li>What are the owner's and the landloard's responsabilities? Does the location rent meet the business budget?</li>\n    <li>Is the location and the building safe? </li>\n    <li>etc...</li>\n</ul>\nThere is a strong African community in Atlanta as well as more and more people willing to try food from the continent. The potential market is large and it could help advance the culture that remains somewhat unknown.   \n  \nFor this work though the word \"African\" is used, it was chosen to be general as the work is meant to be a proof of concept. For an actual customer, it will be better to focus on actually what type of African restaurant is to be opened (i.e. Ivorian, Ethipian, etc...).  \n  \nThe work focuses on trying to help find the best location for a new African restaurant in the city of Atlantaa, GA. The ideal location has few international competitors (international restaurants are limited in a given neighborhood), but is still known for its restaurant and activities (top places are restaurants, and other venue catogires that attract lots of people regularly). This location also has low crime rate as well as a cheap rent.  \n  \nObviously, choosing the right neighborhoods gets complicated when taking into account all these parameters. Using clustering algorithms, it is possible to group neighborhoods by their similarities, which would help the restaurant owner find a list of potential neighborhoods in which the business will strive.
